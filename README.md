# Sistemas_Operativos

This project was made to pursue an avaluation in Sistemas Operativos (SO) of university course. It is completely written in C.

It consists in understanding the functioning of the informatic system. In this project is separeted in two diferent parts. One is the server and the other one is the 
client.

 The server has the hability to store in memory and in files informations that will be needed by the client in order to satisfy the orders given by the user. 
 
 The client will have an interface in which it will receive the orders given by the user, and if necessary pass the information needed to the server. After the server or the client performs what was asked it returns information to the user via standard output.

 For all this to be possible, it is used system calls thoughout the whole project. For more information about what it does, you can go to "Enunciado".
